# Logistic-Regression-Implementation-and-Evaluation


This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of Logistic Regression.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two parts:

- **Part 1: Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset**
  - Implemented Logistic Regression using the Scikit-learn library on the well-known Iris dataset.
  - Evaluated model performance using accuracy and error rate metrics.
  - Provided comprehensive explanations of the evaluation results.

- **Part 2: Logistic Regression on Custom Dataset**
  - Selected and pre-processed a custom dataset[Diabetes prediction dataset], including tasks like data cleaning and noise removal.
  - Implemented Logistic Regression and evaluated the model using precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
  - Wrote custom code for evaluation metrics, providing detailed explanations and analysis of the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
